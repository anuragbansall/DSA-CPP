    Queue:

    Queue is a linear data structure that follows the FIFO (First In First Out) principle.
    The element that is added first to the queue will be the first one to be removed.
    It is used in scenarios where order of processing is important, such as task scheduling, breadth-first search, etc.

    - FIFO (First In First Out)
    - Enqueue (Insert)
    - Dequeue (Remove)
    - Peek (Get the front element)
    - IsEmpty (Check if the queue is empty)
