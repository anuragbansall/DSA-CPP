## Introduction

This repository aims to provide clear and concise implementations of various data structures and algorithms in C++. It is suitable for beginners who are learning data structures and algorithms for the first time, as well as for intermediate and advanced programmers who want to brush up their skills or use these implementations in their projects.

## Features

- **Comprehensive Coverage**: Includes a wide range of data structures such as arrays, linked lists, stacks, queues, trees, graphs, and more.
- **Algorithms**: Implements common algorithms including sorting, searching, dynamic programming, and greedy algorithms.
- **Example Usage**: Provides example usage for each data structure and algorithm to help you understand how to integrate them into your projects.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have met the following requirements:
- You have a C++ compiler installed (e.g., GCC, Clang, MSVC).
- You have basic knowledge of C++ programming.

## Installation

To install and use the code from this repository, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the repository**:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/anuragbansall/DSA-CPP.git
    cd DSA-CPP
    ```

2. **Compile the code**:
    Navigate to the directory containing the file you want to compile and run:
    ```bash
    g++ -o output_file example_file.cpp
    ./output_file
    ```

## Usage

Each data structure and algorithm is implemented in its own file within the repository. You can include these files in your C++ projects and use them as needed.
