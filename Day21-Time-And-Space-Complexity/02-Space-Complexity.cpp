/*
    Space Complexity:
        - Space complexity is a measure of how efficient your code is in terms of memory usage.
        - It is the amount of memory used by the algorithm (including the input values to the algorithm) to execute and produce the result.
        - It is not the amount of memory used by the program itself, but the amount of memory used by the algorithm to execute and produce the result.
        - Generally, space complexity is measured in terms of the number of memory cells used by the algorithm.
        - But, most of the time, we try optimize the time complexity as space is not a big issue in most of the cases, but time is precious.
        - Space complexity is also expressed in Big O notation.
