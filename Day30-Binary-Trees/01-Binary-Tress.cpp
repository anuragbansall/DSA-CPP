/*
    Binary Trees:
    - A tree data structure in which each node has at most two children, referred to as the left child and the right child.
    - The topmost node is called the root.
    - Each node contains a value and pointers to its left and right children.
    - Binary trees are used in various applications, including searching, sorting, and hierarchical data representation.

    Types of Binary Trees:
    1. Full Binary Tree: Every node has either 0 or 2 children.
    2. Complete Binary Tree: All levels are completely filled except possibly the last level, which is filled from left to right.
    3. Perfect Binary Tree: All internal nodes have two children, and all leaves are at the same level.
    4. Balanced Binary Tree: The height of the left and right subtrees of any node differ by at most one.

    - General Tree: A tree data structure where nodes can have any number of children.
    Note: In Binary Trees, each node can have at most two children.

    - Max Level Nodes in a Binary Tree: For a binary tree of height 'h', the maximum number of nodes is given by the formula 2^(h+1) - 1. This is because each level 'i' can have up to 2^i nodes, and summing these from level 0 to level h gives the total number of nodes.
